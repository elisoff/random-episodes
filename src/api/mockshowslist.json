The series provides a voyeuristic look into the lives of a group of twentysomething friends whose once rock-solid friendships have been torn apart by betrayal.</p><p>Bay Ridge was made famous by the iconic film \"Saturday Night Fever\" thirty-five years ago. The film's coming-of-age themes of longing for escape and rolling with a tough crowd remain very much the same today. Nothing is more important in these Brooklyn neighborhoods than loyalty, respect and family. This is the story of someone who may have broken that code during an evening clouded in mystery when one friend may have betrayed another by seducing a boyfriend. Vividly shot in a lush documentary style that showcases the urban streetscapes of Brooklyn, <i>Brooklyn 11223</i> follows the story of childhood friends Joey Lynn and Christie and their respective group of friends as they spend their summer learning about themselves, the bonds of friendship and the price of betrayal.</p>",

Sassy, streetwise Max Black works two jobs just to get by, one of which is waiting tables during the night shift at the retro-hip Williamsburg Diner. Sophisticated Caroline Channing is an uptown trust fund princess who's having a run of bad luck that forces her to reluctantly give waitressing a shot. At first, Max sees Caroline as yet another in a long line of inept servers she must cover for, but she's surprised to find that Caroline has as much substance as she does style.</p><p>When Caroline discovers Max's knack for baking amazing cupcakes, she sees a lucrative future for them, but first they need to raise the start-up money. While they save their tips, they'll stay at the restaurant, working with Oleg, an overly flirtatious Russian cook; Earl, a 75-year-old kool-kat cashier; and Han Lee, the new, eager-to-please owner of the diner. Working together, these two broke girls living in one expensive city might just find the perfect recipe for their big break.</p>",
